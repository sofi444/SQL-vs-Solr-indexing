34878743,"COVID-19, anticoagulation and venous thromboembolism: what have we learned ?","Severe COVID-19 is associated with venous thromboembolic events and and immuno-thrombotic phenomena, responsible for pulmonary vascular damage. This review summarizes the current knowledge on thrombotic risk in COVID-19 inpatients, the potential predictive factors (including D-dimer) and the randomized trials studying the effect of intermediate or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation on the clinical and thrombotic prognosis. Despite the initial hope, therapeutic anticoagulation does not improve the clinical prognosis in critically ill inpatients, and standard prophylactic anticoagulation is therefore recommended. In non-critical inpatients, the use of therapeutic anticoagulation may help reduce the risk of severe clinical deterioration, but its risk-benefit will be clarified in ongoing studies and meta-analyzes.","Revue medicale suisse","{""Blondon, Marc"",""Robert-Ebadi, Helia""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

34878753,"ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment among patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease.","Many patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience a delay in treatment or fail to initiate treatment with guideline-recommended angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) after CKD diagnosis. This study aimed to describe treatment patterns and treatment initiation after initial CKD diagnosis among patients with T2D. Retrospective analysis using data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart administrative claims database (January 2014-September 2018). Adult patients with T2D entered the cohort if they met the criteria for CKD, defined as 2 laboratory test results 90 to 365 days apart (January 2014-September 2017) indicating CKD. Included were patients with no prior use of ACEis or ARBs or evidence of kidney disease in the 365 days prior to cohort entry (baseline). Patients were followed for a maximum of 365 days and were censored on death, disenrollment, or end of data. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and medication use were assessed at baseline, and treatments were assessed over a 1-year followup period. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with ACEi or ARB initiation. Among 15,400 eligible patients without prior ACEi or ARB treatment, only 17% initiated such therapy within a year after meeting CKD criteria. Patients who were White, resided in the northeastern United States, had more comorbidities, had less advanced albuminuria, or used sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were less likely to initiatetreatment. A large proportion of patients with T2D meeting criteria for CKD do not initiate the recommended therapy within 1 year of CKD diagnosis, highlighting a need for new therapies that can slow the progression of CKD.","The American journal of managed care","{""Fried, Linda F"",""Petruski-Ivleva, Natalia"",""Folkerts, Kerstin"",""Schmedt, Niklas"",""Velentgas, Priscilla"",""Kovesdy, Csaba P""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

A retrospective cohort study of 52,599 adults with CKD and T2D using Optum Clinformatics claims data from 2014 to 2019. Medical costs associated with CKD management, renal replacement therapies (RRTs), major CKD complications (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hyperkalemia), and death were estimated using generalized estimating equations adjusting for baseline demographics, complications, and medical costs. Costs for CKD management, RRT, and major CKD complications were assessed in 4-month cycles. Mortality costs were assessed in the month before death. The estimated 4-month CKD management costs ranged from $7725 for stage I to II disease to $11,879 for stage V (without RRT), with high additional costs for dialysis and kidney transplantation ($87,538and $124,271, respectively). The acute event costs were $31,063 for heart failure, $21,087 for stroke, and $21,016 for myocardial infarction in the first 4 months after the incident event, which all decreased substantially in subsequent 4-month cycles. The acute event costs of atrial fibrillation and hyperkalemia were $30,500 and $31,212 with hospitalization, and $5162 and $1782 without. The costs associated with cardiovascular-related death, renal-related death, and death from other causes were $17,031, $12,605, and $9900, respectively. Management of CKD and its complications incurs high medical costs for patients with CKD and T2D.

34878755,"FINE-CKD model to evaluate economic value of finerenone in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and irreversible disease often associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). CKD is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular (CV) events, increased mortality, and diminished quality of life. Finerenone is a new treatment for patients with CKD and T2D that delays CKD progression and reduces CVcomplications. To describe the approach and structure of a costeffectiveness model for finerenone for patients with CKD and T2D and compare it with existing economic models in CKD. A de novo cost-effectiveness model (FINE-CKD model), reflective of FIDELIO-DKD results, was developed for finerenone. The FINE-CKD model was designed and implemented in accordance with published guidance on modeling and was developed with input from economic and clinical experts. The final model approach was evaluated against existing modeling structures in CKD identified through a systematic literature review. The FINE-CKD model structure follows recommended modeling guidelines and has been designed in accordance with the best practices of modeling in CKD, while also incorporating important features of the FIDELIO-DKD design and results. The approach is consistent with the published literature, ensuring transparency and minimizing uncertainty that can arise from unnecessary complexity. The FINE-CKD model allows for reliable assessment of benefits and costs related to the use of finerenone in patients with CKD and T2D, and it is a reliable assessment of cost-effectiveness.","The American journal of managed care","{""Pochopień, Michał T"",""Cherney, David Z I"",""Folkerts, Kerstin"",""Levy, Pierre"",""Millier, Aurélie"",""Morris, Stephen"",""Roy-Chaudhury, Prabir"",""Sullivan, Sean D"",""Mernagh, Paul""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

34878757,"Ligand Dynamics in Nanocrystal Solids Studied with Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering.","Nanocrystal surfaces are commonly populated by organic ligands, which play a determining role in the optical, electronic, thermal, and catalytic properties of the individual nanocrystals and their assemblies. Understanding the bonding of ligands to nanocrystal surfaces and their dynamics is therefore important for the optimization of nanocrystals for different applications. In this study, we use temperature-dependent, quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) to investigate the dynamics of different surface bound alkanethiols in lead sulfide nanocrystal solids. We select alkanethiols with mono- and dithiol terminations, as well as different backbone types and lengths. QENS spectra are collected both on a time-of-flight spectrometer and on a backscattering spectrometer, allowing us to investigate ligand dynamics in a time range from a few picoseconds to nanoseconds. Through model-based analysis of the QENS data, we find that ligands can either (1) precess around a central axis, while simultaneously rotating around their own molecular axis, or (2) only undergo uniaxial rotation with no precession. We establish the percentage of ligands undergoing each type of motion, the average relaxation times, and activation energies for these motions. We determine, for example, that dithiols which link facets of neighboring nanocrystals only exhibit uniaxial rotation and that longer ligands have higher activation energies and show smaller opening angles of precession due to stronger ligand-ligand interactions. Generally, this work provides insight into the arrangement and dynamics of ligands in nanocrystal solids, which is key to understanding their mechanical and thermal properties, and, more generally, highlights the potential of QENS for studying ligand behavior.","ACS nano","{""Jansen, Maximilian"",""Juranyi, Fanni"",""Yarema, Olesya"",""Seydel, Tilo"",""Wood, Vanessa""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

34757946,"Anisotropic thermal conductivity and corrugated patterns in single-layer black phosphorus nanoribbon subjected to shear loading: a molecular dynamics study.","Single-layer black phosphorus (SLBP) also known as phosphorene is a recently introduced two-dimensional material with unique structure and promising physical properties that has drawn considerable attention in the field of nanodevices. This structure demonstrates a high anisotropy in mechanical and thermal behavior along zigzag (ZZ) and armchair (AC) principal in-plane directions. Here in this study, it is shown that implementing shear strain on 10nm  50nm SLBP nanoribbons (SLBPNRs) along ZZ and AC directions, the anisotropy leads to different corrugated patterns on the pristine structure. Applying non-equilibrium molecular dynamics under a parameterized Stillinger-Weber potential for modelling SLBP, thermal conductivity (TC) behavior of the sheared SLBPNRs with corrugated patterns are examined. The results show a higher amplitude and wavelength of the corregations on the ZZ-aligned SLBPNRs, which is around two times higher than that of AC-aligned counterparts. Although, it is also shown that unlike some other 2D materials, such as graphene, the wrinkling does not have such a significant effect on TC of SLBP. The phonon density of states results obtained in this work as well as phonon dispersion curves by first-principle calculations in other works concrete this finding. The results show small frequency shifts in both high- and low-frequency phonons, which are not strong enough to affect TC in SLBPNRs. This interesting thermal property of SLBP under shear strain suggests the great potential application of these corrugated structures in nanodevices without any loss of TC abilities.","Journal of physics.

34757948,"Recent progress on selective hydrogenation of phenol toward cyclohexanone or cyclohexanol.","Phenol is considered as an important platform molecule for synthesizing value-added chemical intermediates and products. To date, various strategies for phenol transformation have been developed, and among them, selective hydrogenation of phenol toward cyclohexanone (K), cyclohexanol (A) or the mixture KA oil has been attracted great interest because they are both the key raw materials for the synthesis of nylon 6 and 66, as well as many other chemical products, including polyamides. However, until now it is still challengeable to realize the industrilized application of phenol hydrogenation toward KA oils. To better understand the selective hydrogenation of phenol and fabricate the enabled nanocatalysts, it is necessary to summarize the recent progress on selective hydrogenation of phenol with different catalysts. In this review, we first summarize the selective hydrogenation of phenol toward cyclohexanone or cyclohexanol by different nanocatalysts, and simultaneously discuss the relationship among the active components, type of supports and their performances. Then, the possible reaction mechanism of phenol hydrogenation with the typical metal nanocatalysts is summarized. Subsequently, the possible ways for scale-up hydrogenation of phenol are discussed. Finally, the potential challenges and future developments of metal nanocatalysts for the selective hydrogenation of phenol are proposed.","Nanotechnology","{""Xue, Guangxin"",""Yin, Linlin"",""Shao, Shengxian"",""Li, Guodong""}","{N/A}","2021-11"

34757950,"3D chest tomosynthesis using a stationary flat panel source array and a stationary detector: a Monte Carlo proof of concept.","3D imaging modalities such as computed tomography and digital tomosynthesis typically scan the patient from different angles with a lengthy mechanical movement of a single x-ray tube. Therefore, millions of 3D scans per year require expensive mechanisms to support a heavy x-ray source and have to compensate for machine vibrations and patient movements. However, recent developments in cold-cathode field emission technology allow the creation of compact, stationary arrays of emitters. Adaptix Ltd has developed a novel, low-cost, square array of such emitters and demonstrated 3D digital tomosynthesis of human extremities and small animals. The use of cold-cathode field emitters also makes the system compact and lightweight. This paper presents Monte Carlo simulations of a concept upgrade of the Adaptix system from the current 60 kVp to 90 kVp and 120 kVp which are better suited for chest imaging. Between 90 kVp and 120 kVp, 3D image quality appears insensitive to voltage and at 90 kVp the photon yield is reduced by 40%-50% while effective dose declines by 14%. A square array of emitters can adequately illuminate a subject for tomosynthesis from a shorter source-to-image distance, thereby reducing the required input power, and offsetting the 28%-50% more input power that is required for operation at 90 kVp. This modelling suggests that lightweight, stationary cold-cathode x-ray source arrays could be used for chest tomosynthesis at a lower voltage, with less dose and without sacrificing image quality. This will reduce weight, size and cost, enabling 3D imaging to be brought to the bedside.","Biomedical physics & engineering express","{""Primidis, Thomas G"",""Wells, Stephen G"",""Soloviev, Vadim Y"",""Welsch, Carsten P""}","{N/A}","2021-11"

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is becoming a preferred approach for treating non-invasive or early-stage breast cancer cases. However, local-regional recurrence (LRR) is one of the critical risk factors after BCS. As many as 10-20% of BCS cases may show LRR within 5 years and almost 50% within 10 years. Radiation therapy is one of the treatments used to prevent LRR after breast-conserving surgery. However, because of possible side-effects of radiation therapy, targeted drug delivery systems based on nanofibers loaded with anti-cancer drugs have been explored in recent years to control LRR after BCS. This paper aims to review different polymers and anti-cancer drugs used for developing nanofibrous drug delivery systems against other breast cancer cell lines. It was observed that the utilization of nanofibers scaffolds after mastectomy could decrease the recurrence of breast cancer cells to a great extent as these nanofibrous scaffolds release drugs in a sustained manner for a prolonged time. Besides, the side effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells could be avoided. To the best of our knowledge, no such review paper is available in the literature that focuses only on the nanofibers-based system for breast cancer therapy.","Nanotechnology","{""Hussain, Tanveer"",""Ramakrishna, Seeram"",""Abid, Sharjeel""}","{N/A}","2021-11"

Assessing the detrimental effect of interplay and the clinical robustness of several mitigation techniques requires statistical evaluation procedures that take into account the variability of breathing during dose delivery. In this study, we present such a statistical method to model intra-fraction respiratory motion based on breathing signals and assess clinical relevant aspects related to the practical evaluation of interplay in IMPT such as how to model irregular breathing, how small breathing changes affect the final dose distribution, and what is the statistical power (number of different scenarios) required for trustworthy quantification of interplay effects. First, two data-driven methodologies to generate artificial patient-specific breathing signals are compared: a simple sinusoidal model, and a precise probabilistic deep learning model generating very realistic samples of patient breathing. Second, we investigate the highly fluctuating relationship between interplay doses and breathing parameters, showing that small changes in breathing period result in large local variations in the dose. Our results indicate that using a limited number of samples to calculate interplay statistics introduces a bigger error than using simple sinusoidal models based on patient parameters or disregarding breathing hysteresis during the evaluation. We illustrate the power of the presented statistical method by analyzing interplay robustness of 4DCT and Internal Target Volume (ITV) treatment plans for a 8 lung cancer patients, showing that, unlike 4DCT plans, even 33 fraction ITV plans systematically fail to fulfill robustness requirements.","Physics in medicine and biology","{""Pastor-Serrano, Oscar"",""Habraken, Steven"",""Lathouwers, Danny"",""Hoogeman, Mischa"",""Schaart, Dennis"",""Perkó, Zoltán""}","{N/A}","2021-11"

Youth disseminated messages promoting HIV knowledge and condom use. Using generalized estimating equation models, there was a significant reduction over time (P < 0.001) and a significant time by AI arm interaction (P < 0.001) for condomless anal sex act. There was a significant increase in HIV knowledge over time among PCAs in DC and AI arms. PCA models that promote HIV knowledge and condom use are efficacious for YEH. Youth are able to serve as a bridge between interventionists and their community. Interventionists should consider working with computer scientists to solve implementation problems.","Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)","{""Rice, Eric"",""Wilder, Bryan"",""Onasch-Vera, Laura"",""DiGuiseppi, Graham"",""Petering, Robin"",""Hill, Chyna"",""Yadav, Amulya"",""Lee, Sung-Jae"",""Tambe, Milind""}","{N/A}","2021-12"
34757962,"Selective Microvascular Tissue Transfection Using Minicircle DNA for Systemic Delivery of Human Coagulation Factor IX in a Rat Model Using a Therapeutic Flap.","Gene therapy is a promising treatment for protein deficiency disorders such as hemophilia B. However, low tissue selectivity and efficacy are limitations of systemic vector delivery. The authors hypothesized that selective transfection of rat superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps could provide systemic delivery of coagulation factor IX, preventing the need for systemic vector administration. Minicircle DNA containing green fluorescent protein, firefly luciferase, and human coagulation factor IX were created. Vector constructs were validated by transfecting adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from Wistar rat superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps and evaluating transgene expression by fluorescence microscopy, bioluminescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Minicircle DNA luciferase (10 and 30 g) was injected into murine (wild-type, C57/BL/6) inguinal fat pads (n = 3) and followed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging for 60 days. Wistar rat superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps were transfected with minicircle DNA human coagulation factor IX (n = 9) with plasma and tissue transgene expression measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 2 and 4 weeks. Transfected adipose-derived stromal cells expressed green fluorescent protein for 30 days, luciferase for 43 days, and human coagulation factor IX (21.9  1.2 ng/ml) for 28 days in vitro. In vivo murine studies demonstrated dose-dependence between minicircle DNA delivery and protein expression. Ex vivo rat superficial inferior epigastric artery flap transfection with minicircle DNA human coagulation factor IX showed systemic transgene expression at 2 (266.6  23.4 ng/ml) and 4 weeks (290.1  17.1 ng/ml) compared to control tissue (p < 0.0001). Rat superficial inferior epigastric artery flap transfection using minicircle DNA human coagulation factor IX resulted in systemic transgene detection, suggesting that selective flap or angiosome-based tissue transfection may be explored as a treatment for systemic protein deficiency disorders such as hemophilia B.","Plastic and reconstructive surgery","{""Than, Peter A"",""Davis, Christopher R"",""Rennert, Robert C"",""Morrison, Shane D"",""Findlay, Michael W"",""Kay, Mark A"",""Gurtner, Geoffrey C""}","{N/A}","2021-11"
34757963,"Anesthesia in Total Shoulder Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","For shoulder arthroplasty, regional anesthesia is safer when compared with general anesthesia. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate the superiority of regional anesthesia with respect to pulmonary complications and hospital length of stay. Infiltration of the shoulder with local anesthetics offers no additional benefits compared with single-shot or continuous brachial plexus blocks for shoulder arthroplasty. There is high-quality evidence (Level I) demonstrating lower pain scores and lower perioperative opioid requirements after a continuous peripheral nerve block compared with a single-shot nerve block. However, catheter dislodgment and logistical issues with catheter insertion are impediments to the widespread usage of a continuous nerve block with an indwelling catheter. Liposomal bupivacaine is comparable with non-liposomal local anesthetic agents with respect to pain relief, the opioid-sparing effect, and adverse effects in the first 48 hours after total shoulder arthroplasty. Perioperative dexamethasone administration improves postoperative pain control, decreases perioperative opioid requirements, and reduces postoperative nausea.","JBJS reviews","{""Boin, Michael A"",""Mehta, Devan"",""Dankert, John"",""Umeh, Uchenna O"",""Zuckerman, Joseph D"",""Virk, Mandeep S""}","{N/A}","2021-11"

What are the milestones of the changes in the expert approach to the pharmacological management of myasthenia in the past century? To determine the changes in the experts' approach to the management of myasthenia gravis, as presented in a widely used textbook in the United States. The chapters presenting the management of myasthenia gravis in the 26 editions of Cecil Textbook of Medicine published from 1927 to 2020. Adequate feeding, absolute rest in bed, and ""tonics"" were the only interventions recommended for the care of patients with myasthenia gravis in 1927. Ephedrine and glycine were used in the early 1930s. Treatment with the anticholinesterases physostigmine and neostigmine was recommended in 1937, 3 years after Mary Walker discovered it in the United Kingdom. Immunosuppressant pharmacological interventions with prednisone and azathioprine have been considered the standard since 1975, and intravenous immune globulin was added to usual care in 1996. The newer immunosuppressant drugs mycophenolate, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus have expanded the arsenal since 2008, and the monoclonal antibodies rituximab and eculizumab have been mentioned in the textbooks published in 2012-2020. The first randomized clinical trial of drug therapy for myasthenia gravis was published in 1987. The pharmacological management of myasthenia gravis was revolutionized by the epiphany of an astute clinician in the 1930s. Immunosuppressant treatment was a logical step once the autoimmune nature of the condition was established. The major therapeutic advances highlight the values of empiricism and persistent attention to detail in treating relatively rare chronic disorders.","American journal of therapeutics","{""Manu, Peter"",""Rogozea, Liliana M"",""Roman-Filip, Corina""}","{""Expert Testimony"",Humans,""Myasthenia Gravis"",Prednisone,""Quality of Life"",Rituximab}","0-0"

Additionally, the capacity of SSGs to recreate the official match demands was investigated. Twenty-five elite football players were monitored. Total distance (TD), high-speed running, very high-speed running, sprint and accelerations plus decelerations distance were measured during 20 SSGs formats and 25 official-matches; in SSGs, average heart rate was also collected. During submaximal Yo-Yo test, heart rate at peak exercise, heart rate post-60s recovery and rate of perceived exertion were collected. Coefficient of variation, interclass correlation-coefficient and correlation-coefficient analysis were used to calculate validity, reliability, construct validity and, internal and external responsiveness of SSGs demands. In SSGs, a small variability (~6.0%) with moderate reliability (~0.542 to ~0.663) was found in TD and heart rate, while a high variability (~20.8% to ~60.3%) with poor to moderate reliability (~0.358 to ~0.605) was observed in the other metrics; in submaximal Yo-Yo, heart rate showed small variability (~3.7%) with good reliability (~0.933 to ~0.916). The SSGs demands showed poor internal and external responsiveness (p>0.05) to the training-induced aerobic adaptations as assessed by submaximal Yo-Yo. The construct validity of SSGs showed overall large to very large correlations (r=0.53 to 0.90, p<0.05) between SSGs and official match demands across the season. SSGs should not replace standardized field tests to detect the training-induced aerobic adaptations. However, SSGs could be confidently used to recreate specific contextual factors in elite football players.","The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness","{""Riboli, Andrea"",""Dellal, Alexandre"",""Esposito, Fabio"",""Coratella, Giuseppe""}","{N/A}","2021-11"

India recently experienced an unprecedented transmission surge, likely fueled by a premature reopening, the highly transmissible delta variant, and low vaccination rates. Indian media have reported high degrees of vaccine hesitancy, which could interfere with efforts to prevent future surges, making it crucial to better understand the reasons for such reluctance in vulnerable populations, such as people living with HIV. We conducted telephone interviews with 438 people living with HIV who were participants in a longitudinal cohort, designed to examine and validate novel antiretroviral therapy ART adherence measures. Interviews were conducted in January and February 2021 and covered COVID-19-related questions on confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy, worries of vaccine side effects, trust in COVID-19 information from specific sources, and intent to get vaccinated. Over one-third of participants (38.4%, n = 168) met our definition of ""vaccine hesitant"" by reporting being either unlikely to get vaccinated at all or wanting to wait. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with lack of confidence in vaccine safety, concerns about side effects and efficacy, and distrust in common sources of vaccine-related information. These results highlight several challenges for vaccination efforts. Campaigns may benefit from using trusted sources, including antiretroviral therapy center staff, providing clear information about safety and efficacy and emphasizing the role of vaccines in preventing severe disease, hospitalizations and death, and the reduction of forward transmission to unvaccinated household members.","Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)","{""Ekstrand, Maria L"",""Heylen, Elsa"",""Gandhi, Monica"",""Steward, Wayne T"",""Pereira, Matilda"",""Srinivasan, Krishnamachari""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

We assessed differences by HIV status and associations between social disruption and psychosocial health. A cross-sectional telephone/videoconference administered survey of 3411 PLHIV and HIV-negative participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). An instrument combining new and validated measures was developed to assess COVID-19 prevention efforts, social disruptions (loss of employment, childcare, health insurance, and financial supports), experiences of abuse, and psychosocial health. Interviews were performed between April and June 2020. Associations between social disruptions and psychosocial health were explored using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for sociodemographics and HIV status. Almost all (97.4%) participants reported COVID-19 prevention behavior; 40.1% participants reported social disruptions, and 34.3% reported health care appointment disruption. Men living with HIV were more likely than HIV-negative men to experience social disruptions (40.6% vs. 32.9%; P < 0.01), whereas HIV-negative women were more likely than women with HIV to experience social disruptions (51.1% vs. 39.8%, P < 0.001). Participants who experienced 2 social disruptions had significantly higher odds of depression symptoms [aOR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 1.56], anxiety (aOR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.17 to 2.27), and social support dissatisfaction (aOR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.60). This study builds on emerging literature demonstrating the psychosocial health impact related to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing context specific to PLHIV.

However, the extent to which disruptions in care have materialized since the start of the pandemic is not well understood. We use electronic health records to investigate how the pandemic has affected clinic visits, patients' antiretroviral therapy (ART) supply, and viral suppression for a cohort of 14,632 HIV clients from a large HIV clinic in Kampala, Uganda. We complement this with an analysis of electronically measured longitudinal ART adherence data from a subcohort of 324 clients. Clinic visits decreased by more than 50% after a national lockdown started. The risk of patients running out of ART on a given day increased from 5% before the lockdown to 25% 3 months later (Relative Risk Ratio of 5.11, 95% confidence interval: 4.99 to 5.24) and remained higher than prelockdown 6 months later at 13% (Relative Risk Ratio of 2.60; 95% confidence interval: 2.52 to 2.70). There was no statistically significant change in electronically measured adherence or viral suppression. We document substantial gaps in HIV care after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda. This suggests that measures to improve access should be explored as the pandemic persists. However, ART adherence was unaffected for the subcohort for whom we measured electronic adherence. This suggests that some clients may have stockpiles of ART tablets from previous prescriptions that allowed them to keep taking their medication even when they could not visit the clinic for ART refills.","Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)","{""Wagner, Zachary"",""Mukasa, Barbara"",""Nakakande, Josephine"",""Stecher, Chad"",""Saya, Uzaib"",""Linnemayr, Sebastian""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

A universal HCV screening was conducted in a maximum-security central prison (Klong Prem Central Prison) in Thailand. HCV RNA-confirmed prisoners were treated with generic sofosbuvir/velpatasvir by prison health care workers, regardless of their HCV genotypes and duration of prison sentences. We evaluated the SVR rates at 12 weeks after completing direct acting antivirals (DAA) treatment. A total of 68 prisoners with detectable HCV RNA received DAA treatment. The median age and duration of prison sentences were 44 years (interquartile range, 41-53) and 25 (interquartile range, 19-33) years, respectively. Twenty-five percentage of the participants was coinfected with HIV, and 6% of the participants was coinfected with hepatitis B virus. Among all prisoners who received DAA treatment, 20 (29%) had genotype (GT)-1a, 3 (4%) had GT-1b, 22 (32%) had GT-3a, 3 (4%) had GT-3b, and 7 (10%) had GT-6. Overall, improvements in liver biomarkers were seen after HCV treatment, and SVR was achieved in 97% of the participants with per-protocol analysis and in 90% of the participants with intention-to-treat analysis. HCV treatment using DAA among prisoners through universal test-and-treat approach led by prison health care workers is highly effective and safe, and such model can potentially help to facilitate the goals of HCV microelimination among prisoners in Thailand.","Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)","{""Supanan, Ruamthip"",""Han, Win Min"",""Harnpariphan, Weerakit"",""Ueaphongsukkit, Thornthun"",""Ubolyam, Sasiwimol"",""Sophonphan, Jiratchaya"",""Tangkijvanich, Pisit"",""Thanprasertsuk, Sombat"",""Avihingsanon, Anchalee"","", ""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

Multimorbidity is associated with frailty, yet effects of specific comorbidities on transition to frailty in PWH are unknown. Prospective study of 219 PWH age 45 years or older in the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium. Frailty status was categorized using Fried frailty phenotype criteria. Comorbidities [bone disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, renal disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, cancers, neuropsychiatric conditions] were assessed from longitudinal data. Associations between baseline comorbidities and transition to frailty within 30 months were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. Grip strength was assessed using mixed-effects models. At baseline, the median age was 61 years, 73% were male 98% were on antiretroviral therapy, 29% had 3 comorbidities, 27% were robust, and 73% were pre-frail. Cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and COPD were independent predictors of transition to frailty within 30 months in models adjusted for age, sex, and multimorbidity (3 additional comorbidities) [hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) 2.52 (1.29 to 4.93), 2.31 (1.12 to 4.76), and 1.82 (0.95 to 3.48), respectively]. Furthermore, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, or liver disease co-occurring with multimorbidity was associated with substantially increased frailty hazards compared with multimorbidity alone (hazard ratios 4.75-7.46). Cerebrovascular disease was associated with decreased baseline grip strength (P = 0.0001), whereas multimorbidity, diabetes, and COPD were associated with declining grip strength (P < 0.10). In older PWH, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, or liver disease co-occurring with multimorbidity is associated with substantially increased risk of becoming frail within 30 months.

Given the poor outcomes associated with TJA infection, we recommend that candidates with HCV receive treatment prior to elective TJA. Interferon and ribavirin have historically been the standard treatment regimen for the management of HCV; however, adverse events and an inconsistent viral response have limited the efficacy of these therapies. The advent of direct-acting antivirals has resolved many of the issues associated with interferon and ribavirin regimens. Despite the success of direct-acting antivirals, there are still barriers to seeking treatment for TJA candidates with HCV. Many patients are faced with financial burdens, as insurance coverage of direct-acting antiviral therapies is inconsistent and varies by the patient's state of residence and specific treatment regimen. TJA candidates with HCV present health-care providers with a unique set of challenges, often encompassing economic, psychosocial, and complex medical concerns. Multidisciplinary care teams can be beneficial when caring for and optimizing this patient cohort. Management of HCV prior to elective TJA is associated with higher up-front costs but ultimately reduces long-term patient morbidity as well as associated direct and indirect health-care expenditures.","JBJS reviews","{""Ross, Phillip E"",""Young, Joseph R"",""O Connor, Casey M"",""Anoushiravani, Afshin A"",""DiCaprio, Matthew R""}","{N/A}","2021-11"

With increasing pressure to reduce costs, further underscored by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many health-care organizations will move toward outpatient interventions to conserve inpatient resources. Although abundant literature has shown the advantages of outpatient total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there is a relative paucity describing outpatient shoulder arthroplasty. Thus, the purpose of this study was to summarize the peer-reviewed literature of outpatient shoulder arthroplasty with particular attention to patient selection, patient outcomes, and cost benefits. The PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Embase databases were queried according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All articles on outpatient shoulder arthroplasty were included. Data on patient selection, patient outcomes, and cost analyses were recorded. Patient outcomes, including complications, reoperations, and readmissions, were analyzed by weighted average. Twenty-three articles were included for analysis. There were 3 review articles and 20 studies with Level-III or IV evidence as assessed per The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery Level of Evidence criteria. Patient selection was most often predicated on age <70 years, body mass index (BMI) <35 kg/m2, absence of active cardiopulmonary comorbidities, and presence of home support. Complications and readmissions were not common and either improved or were equivalent to those of inpatient shoulder arthroplasty. Patient satisfaction was high in studies of short-term and intermediate-term follow-up. The proposed cost benefit ranged from $747 to $53,202 with outpatient shoulder arthroplasty. The published literature to date supports outpatient shoulder arthroplasty as an effective, safe, and cost-reducing intervention with proper patient selection. Therapeutic Level IV.

In one case, none of 20 pathologists recognized a tumor with BRAF and TERT promoter mutations associated with fatal outcome as a conventional melanoma when only limited clinical information was provided, whereas 60% of pathologists correctly diagnosed this case when genomic information was also available. There was also a significant improvement in agreement of which lesions should be classified in the Spitz category/WHO Pathway from an average Cohen  of 0.360 (SE=0.00921) to 0.607 (SE=0.0232) with genomics.","The American journal of surgical pathology","{""Benton, Sarah"",""Zhao, Jeffrey"",""Zhang, Bin"",""Bahrami, Armita"",""Barnhill, Raymond L"",""Busam, Klaus"",""Cerroni, Lorenzo"",""Cook, Martin G"",""de la Fouchardière, Arnaud"",""Elder, David E"",""Johansson, Iva"",""Landman, Gilles"",""Lazar, Alexander"",""LeBoit, Philip"",""Lowe, Lori"",""Massi, Daniela"",""Duncan, Lyn M"",""Messina, Jane"",""Mihic-Probst, Daniela"",""Mihm, Martin C"",""Piepkorn, Michael W"",""Schmidt, Birgitta"",""Scolyer, Richard A"",""Shea, Christopher R"",""Tetzlaff, Michael T"",""Tron, Victor A"",""Xu, Xiaowei"",""Yeh, Iwei"",""Yun, Sook Jung"",""Zembowicz, Artur"",""Gerami, Pedram""}","{Adult,""Biomarkers, Tumor"",Biopsy,""DNA Mutational Analysis"",Female,""High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing"",Humans,Male,""Middle Aged"",Mutation,""Nevus, Epithelioid and Spindle Cell"",""Observer Variation"",""Predictive Value of Tests"",""Reproducibility of Results"",""Skin Neoplasms""}","2021-12"

To eliminate these health disparities, intentional and targeted interventions that address the needs and preferences of diverse populations are needed. To address disparities, the California HIV/AIDS Research Program focused their funding resources tightly on communities facing elevated HIV incidence or prevalence. This special issue describes interventions that aimed to increase linkage to and engagement in HIV-specific prevention or medical care, each uniquely tailored to the needs of an identified California population with disparate HIV-related health outcomes and each for implementation at a specific stage of the HIV prevention and care continuum.","Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)","{""Lightfoot, Marguerita"",""Milburn, Norweeta"",""Loeb Stanga, Lisa""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

The House Ball and gay family communities encompass sexual and ethnic minority youth who form chosen families that promote protective HIV-related health behaviors. We conducted a small-scale trial of the We Are Family intervention, leveraging these existing social dynamics to address HIV. From September 2018 to September 2019, we enrolled N = 118 for baseline and 6-month follow-up assessments. Eligible participants were 18 years or older, San Francisco Bay Area residents, members of a house or gay family or ball attendees in the past year, smartphone users, and sexually active. The intervention included one 2-hour in-person group session, community-level events, a mobile health app, and a dedicated service provider. Ninety-seven percent of our participants were people of color, 94% were retained through follow-up. 73% attended at least 1 group session, 100% used the mobile health app, and 56% attended a community-level event. Modest changes were observed baseline to follow-up: among all participants, any condomless anal intercourse past 3 months (74.6%-66.7%, P = 0.064); among HIV-negative participants (N = 82) HIV testing past 6 months (80.7%-87.2%, P = 0.166); among HIV-positive participants (N = 34) receiving HIV primary care past 6 months (64.5%-78.8%, P = 0.139), and adherent to ART past 30 days (22.6%-28.1%, P = 0.712). 86% would be willing to refer a friend to the app, and 65% found the app to be personally relevant.

34757988,"Structural Syndemics and Antiretroviral Medication Adherence Among Black Sexual Minority Men Living With HIV.","Although HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART) access and uptake have increased among racial/ethnic minority individuals, lower rates of ART adherence and viral suppression persist, especially among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) compared with their White counterparts. Black men who have sex with men living with HIV (BMSM+) residing in Los Angeles County (N = 124) were recruited in-person (eg, clinic) and online (eg, social networking apps). Participants completed a cross-sectional survey measuring demographic characteristics, structural syndemics (poverty, criminal justice involvement, and housing instability), and psychosocial syndemics (mental health and substance use). A text message survey assessed missed doses of ART over the past week. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models were used to evaluate variables associated with the number of missed doses of ART. On average, participants missed 1.30 doses of ART (SD = 2.09) and reported structural syndemics: poverty (56.1%), criminal justice involvement (36.6%), housing instability (26.3%), and psychosocial syndemics: childhood sexual abuse (51.8%), intimate partner violence (16.9%), depression (39%), and problem alcohol use (15.5%). After controlling for employment, age, education, and psychosocial syndemics, participants with a one-point increase in structural syndemic indicators were found to be 1.63 times more likely to have missed a dose of ART. Structural syndemic were associated with ART nonadherence among BMSM+ after adjusting for demographic and psychosocial factors. HIV treatment interventions that incorporate financial incentives, legal support, and housing may help improve ART adherence among BMSM+. Findings suggest that key priorities to ending the HIV epidemic must include structural interventions that alleviate poverty, eliminate disproportionate policing and criminalization, and end homelessness.","Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)","{""Holloway, Ian W"",""Beltran, Raiza"",""Shah, Saanchi V"",""Cordero, Luisita"",""Garth, Gerald"",""Smith, Terry"",""Wilson, Bianca D M"",""Ochoa, Ayako M""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

TRIUMPH used peer health education, community mobilization, and clinical integration of PrEP with hormone therapy to promote PrEP knowledge and acceptability. The goal of this study was to evaluate PrEP uptake, retention, and adherence among TRIUMPH participants and examine site-based differences. Eligible participants were adult transgender and gender diverse people interested in PrEP. Participants were seen at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months for PrEP provision, clinical visits, and HIV testing. PrEP uptake was defined as dispensation of PrEP, PrEP retention was defined as proportion of expected visits completed among those who initiated PrEP, and PrEP adherence was assessed by measuring tenofovir diphosphate concentrations in dried blood spots. Logistic regression models quantified the association of variables with PrEP outcomes. TRIUMPH enrolled 185 participants; the median age was 28 years (interquartile range: 23-35), 7% was Black, and 58% was Latinx. PrEP uptake was as follows: 78% in Oakland and 98% in Sacramento; 91% among trans women, 96% among trans men, and 70% among nonbinary participants. Almost half (47%) rarely/never believed about HIV, and 42% reported condomless sex act in the past 3 months. Participants who reported higher numbers of sex partners were more likely to be retained and adherent; other predictors of adherence included not having a primary partner and not experiencing violence in the past 3 months. This community-led, trans-specific PrEP demonstration project documents high levels of PrEP initiation in a young transgender and gender diverse cohort at risk of HIV acquisition.","Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)","{""Sevelius, Jae M"",""Glidden, David V"",""Deutsch, Madeline"",""Welborn, Layla"",""Contreras, Alejandro"",""Salinas, Arianna"",""Venegas, Luz"",""Grant, Robert M""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

Recommendations implemented in San Francisco to offer PrEP with feminizing hormones have not led to improvement of PrEP uptake in trans communities. New delivery models may be needed. The aim of this study was to examine whether a PrEP-only clinic was more likely to serve trans people at highest risk of HIV than trans-affirming primary care clinics. Participants were recruited between 2017 and 2019 as part of a PrEP demonstration project in the San Francisco Bay Area. Survey data including sociodemographics, HIV-related risk behavior, barriers to PrEP, and self-reported PrEP adherence were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months for all participants. Bivariable Poisson regression models were used to examine differences between participants in the primary care clinics and PrEP-only clinic delivered to participants. Baseline survey data were collected from 153 participants. Those with a higher number of sexual partners were significantly more likely to use the PrEP-only clinic rather than the primary care clinics. Participants with higher perceived HIV risk and those who engaged in sex work were also more likely to use the PrEP-only clinic compared with the primary care clinic. Medical mistrust was higher at baseline among participants of the PrEP-only clinic. PrEP adherence was not significantly different by delivery model. Few participants identified PrEP barriers, such as interactions with feminizing hormones, to be determinants of PrEP uptake. A PrEP-only delivery model could improve PrEP uptake and may better meet the needs of trans people who could most benefit from PrEP.","Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)","{""Wilson, Erin C"",""Turner, Caitlin M"",""Sanz-Rodriguez, Christina"",""Arayasirikul, Sean"",""Gagliano, Jayne"",""Woods, Tiffany"",""Palafox, Erika"",""Halfin, Janet"",""Martinez, Lorena"",""Makoni, Bessa"",""Eskman, Zebediah"",""Lin, Royce"",""Rodriguez, Esteban"",""Rapues, Jenna"",""Pardo, Seth"",""Liu, Albert""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

The purpose of this article is to assimilate and critically evaluate recently published literature regarding artificial intelligence applications for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients. Among recent studies regarding artificial intelligence implementations for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients, there are many promising models, but few had external validation, clinical interpretability and high predictive performance. Deep learning techniques leveraging multimodal clinical data show great potential to provide continuous, accurate, early predictions of AKI risk, which could be implemented clinically to optimize preventive and early therapeutic management strategies. Use of consensus criteria, standard definitions and common data models could facilitate access to machine learning-ready data sets for external validation. The lack of interpretability, explainability, fairness and transparency of artificial intelligence models hinder their entrustment and clinical implementation; compliance with standardized reporting guidelines can mitigate these challenges.","Current opinion in critical care","{""Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Tezcan"",""Loftus, Tyler J"",""Ren, Yuanfang"",""Ruppert, Matthew M"",""Bihorac, Azra""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

An earlier-strategy has biological rationale, even in the absence of urgent indications; however, a delayed-strategy may prevent selected patients from receiving RRT and avoid complications related to RRT. Previous studies assessing the optimal timing of RRT initiation found conflicting results, contributing to variation in clinical practice. The recent multinational trial, standard vs. accelerated initiation of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury (STARRT-AKI) found no survival benefit and a higher risk of RRT dependence with an accelerated compared to a standard RRT initiation strategy in critically ill patients with severe AKI. Nearly 40% of patients allocated to the standard-strategy group did not receive RRT. The Artificial Kidney Initiation in Kidney Injury-2 (AKIKI-2) trial further assessed delayed compared to more-delayed strategies for RRT initiation. The more-delayed strategy did not confer an increase in RRT-free days and was associated with a higher risk of death. Early preemptive initiation of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI does not confer clear clinical benefits. However, protracted delays in RRT initiation may be harmful.","Current opinion in critical care","{""Jeong, Rachel"",""Wald, Ron"",""Bagshaw, Sean M""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

In 2019, the US Department of Health and Human Services set national goals targeted at improving the care and outcomes of patients with kidney disease including prevention by reducing the number of Americans who develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) by 25% by 2030. In response to this call to action, there is a need to focus on education to identify patients at high-risk for kidney disease development and progression, active surveillance methods to ensure timely identification, offering better follow-up care after an episode of AKI. A strategic approach to determining the health systems level of commitment and developing a plan for organizational change is discussed in this commentary. Items for consideration are structuring sound implementation projects and selecting implementation interventions. Clinical interventions to consider for implementation include the use of clinical decision support for detecting patients with AKI, novel biomarkers to determine patients at high-risk for AKI and nephrotoxin stewardship to prevent medication safety complications and drug-associated AKI. There is a national call to action to improve the care and outcomes of patients with kidney disease. Health systems have an opportunity to respond by providing a high level of commitment towards ensuring the best kidney health for all patients equally.

34757996,"Postoperative blood pressure management in patients treated in the ICU after noncardiac surgery.","Blood pressure management is a cornerstone of hemodynamic management in patients treated in the ICU after noncardiac surgery. Postoperative blood pressure management is challenging, because blood pressure alterations after surgery can be profound and have numerous causes. Postoperative blood pressure alterations are common in patients treated in ICUs after noncardiac surgery. There is increasing evidence that hypotension during the initial days after noncardiac surgery is associated with postoperative adverse outcomes including myocardial infarction and death, acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, and delirium. Thus, postoperative hypotension could be a modifiable risk factor for postoperative adverse outcomes. However, robust evidence for a causal relationship between postoperative blood pressure and postoperative adverse outcomes is still lacking. Future research on postoperative blood pressure management in patients treated in the ICU after noncardiac surgery needs to assess whether the prevention or treatment of postoperative blood pressure alterations - especially postoperative hypotension - reduces the incidence of postoperative adverse outcomes.","Current opinion in critical care","{""Briesenick, Luisa"",""Flick, Moritz"",""Saugel, Bernd""}","{N/A}","2021-12"

Within ICU-patients, anaemia is highly prevalent. Generally, anaemia is associated with impaired outcome and need of blood transfusion. Currently, with ICUs working at full capacity and the global blood reserves exhausted, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reinforces the need for PBM implementation. For instance, implementation of a comprehensive coagulation management and measures to avoid iatrogenic blood loss may prevent bleeding-associated complications and adherence to blood transfusion guidelines may reduce adverse events associated with transfusion. Critically ill patients display various morbidities often requiring individualized treatment.

The ideal contaminated hernia repair including type of mesh use remains controversial. Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate is a biosynthetic scaffold for soft-tissue reinforcement and hernia repair and is potentially useful in contaminated hernia repair. The authors aim to describe postoperative outcomes, recurrence, and patient-reported outcomes after contaminated hernia repair with poly-4-hydroxybutyrate. Adult patients (18 years) undergoing a contaminated hernia repair with poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (Phasix) performed by a single plastic surgeon between January of 2015 and May of 2020 were identified. Patients with a ventral hernia defect and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wound class of II, III, or IV were included. Primary outcomes included recurrence, surgical-site infection, surgical-site occurrences, and surgical-site infection/occurrences requiring procedural interventions. As a secondary outcome, the authors assessed patient-reported outcomes as defined by the Abdominal Hernia-Q and Hernia-Related Quality of Life Survey. Sixty patients were included with a median age of 52.5 and body mass index of 31 kg/m2. Median defect size was 300 cm2. Twenty-eight patients (46.7 percent) experienced a complication. The most common complications were surgical-site occurrence [n = 20 (33.3 percent)] and surgical-site infection [n = 10 (16.7 percent)]. Median follow-up was 24.2 months, with a recurrence rate of 8.3 percent (n = 4). Overall patient-reported outcomes improved postoperatively, and improvement was not affected by the presence of a complication. Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate use in contaminated hernia repair shows promising results with an acceptable safety profile. Although complications are frequent in this complex cohort, patient-reported outcomes improvement was significant even in patients with complications.

This article presents the authors' technique for composite face lift in Asian patients and reviews their experience and outcome with this procedure. Composite face lifts were performed on 128 Asian patients between January of 2010 and June of 2020. Ninety-four were primary face lifts, and 34 were secondary or tertiary face lifts. The authors' surgical technique and adaptations for the specific requirements of Asian patients are described in detail. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range, 6 to 108 months). Fat grafting was an integral part of our procedure, with 95 percent having concomitant facial fat grafting with their face lift. Patients were followed up in accordance with a standardized schedule. The majority of patients reported high satisfaction with the aesthetic outcome of the technique, with natural, long-lasting results. The face lift plane of dissection is through the facial soft-tissue spaces, which provide atraumatic sub-SMAS access with precise release of the intervening retaining ligaments for effective flap mobilization. By emphasizing tension on the composite flap with no tension on the skin closure, the scars were discrete in the great majority of patients. Complications were few, with no hematomas or skin flap necrosis. The temporary nerve injury rate was 1.5 percent, with no patient having a permanent nerve injury. The composite face lift is an ideal technique for Asian patients as it delivers natural, long-lasting results; a quick recovery; and high patient satisfaction.

Between 1997 and 2017, 1617 breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy and breast reconstruction were analyzed. Those with autologous, tissue expander/implant, and single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction were included. Postmastectomy radiation therapy was delivered either with three-dimensional conformal photon or proton therapy. Complication endpoints were defined based on surgical reintervention operative notes as infection/necrosis requiring dbridement. For implant-based patients, the authors studied capsular contracture requiring capsulotomy and implant failure. For each complication endpoint, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-penalized regression was used to select the subset of predictors associated with the smallest prediction error from 10-fold cross-validation. Nomograms were built using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-selected predictors, and internal validation using cross-validation was performed. Median follow-up was 6.6 years. Among 1617 patients, 23 percent underwent autologous reconstruction, 39 percent underwent direct-to-implant reconstruction, and 37 percent underwent tissue expander/implant reconstruction. Among 759 patients who received postmastectomy radiation therapy, 8.3 percent received proton-therapy to the chest wall and nodes and 43 percent received chest wall boost. Internal validation for each model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 73 percent for infection, 75 percent for capsular contracture, 76 percent for absolute implant failure, and 68 percent for overall implant failure. Periareolar incisions and complete implant muscle coverage were found to be important predictors for infection and capsular contracture, respectively. In a multivariable analysis, we found that protons compared to no postmastectomy radiation therapy significantly increased capsular contracture risk (OR, 15.3; p < 0.001). This was higher than the effect of photons with electron boost versus no postmastectomy radiation therapy (OR, 2.5; p = 0.01). Using machine learning, these nomograms provided prediction of postmastectomy breast reconstruction complications with and without radiation therapy.

CASE REPORT A 64-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of penile induration and dysuria. He was diagnosed with a penile abscess, which was punctured and then relapsed. An incision and drainage were performed on the abscess, and the pus and tissue samples were cultured and examined histologically. There was no evidence of malignancy or bacterial infection, and he was diagnosed with an idiopathic penile abscess. As pus continuously drained from the incision, prednisolone 40 mg was initiated, which resulted in a decreased amount of pus and eventual wound closure. Over 15 months, prednisolone was gradually tapered to 5 mg, and the abscess continued to decrease in size. CONCLUSIONS Idiopathic penile abscesses are rare but often lead to penectomy. Prednisolone is a new treatment method for such patients. This is the third case of an idiopathic penile abscess that was successfully treated with prednisolone. The causative agent of the idiopathic penile abscess was suggested to be pyoderma gangrenosum; however, this case did not exhibit the typical characteristics of pyoderma gangrenosum. Therefore, further investigation was needed. A differential diagnosis of an infectious abscess is required before initiating steroid treatment. Open drainage is useful, but the size of the incision should be minimized for the purpose of preserving penile function. The prednisolone dose should be started at 20 to 40 mg and reduced gradually to avoid relapse.","The American journal of case reports","{""Yamagishi, Atsushi"",""Kurokawa, Masayuki"",""Nishida, Hayato"",""Konno, Takayuki"",""Tsuchiya, Norihiko""}","{Abscess,""Diagnosis, Differential"",Drainage,Humans,Male,""Middle Aged"",Prednisolone,""Pyoderma Gangrenosum""}","2021-11"

Physical therapy is established as adjuvant treatment on physical conditions. The aim of this study was to monitor the level of physical fitness and anthropometric parameters of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, who had participated in physical exercise programs for 8-years. 71 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (53.50% males), mean age 71.199.04 years old, with a mean disease stage of 2.520.77 (Hoehn and Yahr scale). All patients underwent an assessment of fitness and body composition at baseline (2011), 4-years, and 8-years. The study of the anthropometric parameters showed that throughout the 8 years of follow-up, the BMI has not undergone significant changes and shows a small upward trend for both men (0.30%, sig=0.938) and women(-0.10%, sig=0.817). This same behavior was reflected by the weight in men (1.36%, sig=0.315) and in women (-0.35%, sig=0.787). In terms of physical fitness, men showed a trend towards a deterioration in this parameter over the 8 years of follow-up (Fitness = -1.82%, sig = 0.930), while women showed a trend towards improvement (Fitness = 0.96%, sig = 0.821). The same is recorded for strength and flexibility, where the data suggest that these are two of the variables that deteriorated the most over the 8 years of the study.
