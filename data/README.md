### 'data_sample' is a zipped folder which contains:

  + 1x zipped file (original - .gz)
  + 1x md5 file (comes with the download of the data. 
      Used for verifying integrity of the downloaded file)
  + 1x (a sample of) extracted xml file (original, before parsing).
      These xml files are very large. I uploaded one that only contains 10 PubMed articles
  + 1x JSON file (after parsing)
  + 1x reduced XML file (after parsing)
